# AzureCasts #005: Using Make to Orchestrate Shell Scripts

In this video I'll take control of the shell commands that I've been using in episodes #001 and #003, first adding them to a script file and then orchestrating things a bit more carefully with Make. You don't have to understand Make to benefit from this video and yes, I might be abusing it just a little bit... but it's for a good cause!
